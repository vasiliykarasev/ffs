FFS is FFS Financial Simulator.

## What it is?

Rather than being a personal finance/wealth management app, this software
package provides portfolio analysis, benchmarking, and forecasting tools.

The aim is to provide mechanisms to perform various "what if" calculations -- specifically related to analysis of expected return, volatility, tax implications, and so on.
